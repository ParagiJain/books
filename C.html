       <hr><h3><center>INTRODUCTION TO C PROGRAMMING</center></h3><hr>
       <p> C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer
        programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the
        Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. 
        C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating
        at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming
        language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among
        modern software programmers.

            Learning C programming has lot of benefits, but the foremost thing in which it helps is to
            understand the underlying architecture of how things works?. It was mainly developed as a 
            system programming language to write operating system.<br>
