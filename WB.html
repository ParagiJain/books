           great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding
           languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

           development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side).<BR></P>
