       <p> The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have
        already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially,
        i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with 
        the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let's see the different types of data structures.
        The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to
        structure the data in the memory.<br></P>

            Computer science is all about storing and computing from a given data. So studying data structures helps in dealing with different ways
            of arranging, processing and storing data.All codes are made for real time purpose so data structure allow user to provide/use/handle
            date in different ways.<br>
