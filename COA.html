        <HR><h3><center>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE AND ORGANIZATION</center></h3><hr>
       <p>         Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal working, structuring
        and implementation of a computer system. Architecture in computer system, same as
        anywhere else, refers to the externally visual attributes of the system. Externally 
        visual attributes, here in computer science, mean the way a system is visible to the
        logic of programs (not the human eyes!). Organization of computer system is the way 
        of practical implementation which results in realization of architectural specifications
        of a computer system.In more general language, Architecture of computer system can be
        considered as a catalog of tools available for any operator using the system, while 
        Organization will be the way the system is structured so that all those cataloged tools
        can be used, and that in an efficient fashion.

        <p>
            The subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and
            how it works will help in design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper,
            more efficient, and easier to use because we will be able to make informed decisions instead of
            guestimating and assuming.<br>
