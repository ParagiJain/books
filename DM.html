        <hr><h3><center>INTRODUCTION TO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS</center></h3><hr>
       <p> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.
         In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics –
         such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic– do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.
         Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete
         objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch 
         mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However,
         there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics." Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is
         included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.<br></P>

        <hr><h3><center>EXPECTATION</center></h3><hr>
        <p>
            Discrete mathematics is the mathematical language of computer science. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are
            useful in studying and describing objects and problems in all branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms,
            programming languages, cryptography , automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations
            are tremendously significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world applications, such as in operations research.
